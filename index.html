          <div class="about-flip-card-back">
           <p>
              When I think about happiness, I don’t picture fireworks, loud celebrations, or the dramatic endings of movies.
              I picture small, almost invisible things: the warmth of the first coffee on a cold morning, the quiet of my room after a long, overwhelming day,
              or a simple message from someone I care about saying, “You crossed my mind.”
            </p>
            <p>
              These moments are too gentle to share online, yet they shape the rhythm of my days.
              For me, happiness often looks like this: a soft, steady feeling in the background,
              a quiet reminder that "right now, in this moment, things are okay enough".

          </div>
          <div class="about-flip-card-back">
            <p>
            One of the happiest moments I remember came from a day that looked completely ordinary.
            I was taking the long way home after classes, walking through a neighborhood I didn’t usually explore.
            The rain had stopped not long before, so the pavement reflected the streetlights, and the whole place felt a bit quieter than usual.
            I had my headphones on, playing a song I had found earlier that week.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nothing remarkable happened — no big news, no surprise, no special event.
            But at some point, while passing a row of quiet houses, something about the mix of fresh air, music, and empty streets
            made everything feel strangely balanced. For a moment, I wasn’t rushing anywhere or thinking about anything.
            If I had to name that feeling, it would simply be:
            <strong>“This moment makes sense.”</strong>

              <p>
                In psychology, happiness is usually seen as a combination of two things:
                <strong>positive emotions</strong> and a general sense that your life is moving in a good direction,
                also called <strong>life satisfaction</strong>.
                It’s not about feeling great every day, but about having a deeper sense that your life has meaning and value,
                even when some days are difficult.
              </p>
                <p>
                  Thinking about happiness this way makes it feel less like a mood and more like a steady foundation in the background.

                When I asked a few people what happiness means to them, I received different answers:

              <ul>
                <li>“Happiness is when my family is healthy and close to me.”</li>
                <li>“Happiness is doing something creative until I forget the time.”</li>
                <li>“Happiness is when I am at peace with my decisions, even if they are hard.”</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These answers remind me that happiness is deeply personal and cannot be measured with one universal scale.

              <p>
                I sometimes imagine happiness in contexts that do not exist, just to stretch my understanding.
                What would happiness mean in a world without time, where nothing changes?
                Would we still need goals, expectations, or memories?
              </p>
              <p>
                In that imaginary world, maybe happiness would not be about “more” or “better”.
                It would only be the pure experience of existing. Thinking about this makes me appreciate
                our imperfect world, where happiness is shaped by change, endings, and the possibility of loss.

          <p>
            At the end of the day, I take five minutes to scan the last 24 hours and write down
            three very specific things I am grateful for: a sentence someone said, a smell, a color,
            a moment when I felt understood.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experiment showed me that happiness is often already present, but hidden under noise and hurry.

          <p>
            Once a week, I block one hour with no social media, no notifications, and no background videos.
            During that time, I either walk, read, draw, or simply allow myself to be bored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is not always dramatic joy, but a clearer mind.
            I noticed that happiness sometimes appears when my attention is not constantly pulled in ten directions.

            In this experiment, I choose one person and decide to be fully present with them for at least
            ten minutes: no phone on the table, no multitasking, no rush to fix anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Very often, happiness shows up in these short, focused conversations,
            where I feel both vulnerable and safe.

        <p>
          After researching, observing, and playing with the word
          <strong>happiness</strong>, I no longer see it as a final state that I must
          reach and then keep perfectly forever. I see it as a rhythm: a movement
          between joy and difficulty, between gain and loss, between certainty and doubt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Happiness, in this new understanding, is not the opposite of sadness.
          It is the ability to notice the good that exists <em>alongside</em> the
          complicated parts of life, and to remain curious instead of numb.
